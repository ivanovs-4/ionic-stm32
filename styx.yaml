# List the packages that you edit locally and want compiled "all the time", by cabal:
local-packages:
  blink-ion: # package name
    location: . # location on your disk (directory)
  # my-local-dep:    # package name
  #   location: dep  # location on your disk (directory)

# Optionally, list patched or cutting edge packages that you depend on.
# These will be compiled only once, by nix.

# source-deps:
#   mtl:
#     location: https://github.com/mrawesome/awsm-patched-version-of-mtl.git
#     # revision: cc9a31305421f6bc72cc1f107f1270bd178c78a1 # optional

# Optionally, add other haskell nix packages to depend on.
# Normally this is not necessary, because nix will track the dependencies on its own.
# Thus this section is mostly useful for throw-away projects which do not have a well-formed cabal file.
# nix-deps:
#   - serialport-0.4.7
#     - criterion
#     - gasp
#     - lens
#     - statistics

# In case you depend on other non-haskell tools or libs.
# non-haskell-deps:
#     - z3

# Optionally, one can ask for a specific version of nixpkgs:

# nixpkgs:
#   commit: 2255f292063ccbe184ff8f9b35ce475c04d5ae69
#   sha256: 0vw5gzql7y3g287qfxmlpqvwvbv7an7lixgm3z02qa7v8qasi4hn

  # or like this: url: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs-channels/archive/nixos-14.12.tar.gz

# Optionally, one can ask for a specific version of ghc, as known by nixpkgs
# default-compiler: ghc801
